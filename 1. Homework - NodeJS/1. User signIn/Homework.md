# Assignment 01

Create an app that asks the user for username and password input.
The app should look for the specific username in a .json file,
if the user exists and the password is correct, the user should get a message
in the console "User logged in!"
If the password was wrong or the user does not exist, the user should get an appropriate message.

Bonus: Add a register user option, allowing you to insert new users in the .json database.
